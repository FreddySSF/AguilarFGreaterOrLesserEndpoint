# AguilarFGreaterOrLesserEndpoint

// Opening the file AguilarFGreaterOrLesserEndpoint in vs code, turn on the debug feture and let it run. Once it has finished running the
// localhost page will show up and say it can't be found. Return to the debug console in vs sharp and copy + paste the http url ( example: http://localhost:5250 ).
// Open up Postman in your web browser and create a new http request. Paste the http into the request. You type in / and then the name of the controller
// including what goes in after the route in parenthesis. With another dash you input the values you wish for {number1} and {number2}.
// Enter send and the url should output into postman whether the number chosen by 
// the user {number1} is greater than, less than or equal too the second number chosen {number2}!

// Peer Reviewed By: Jovann Contreras - Code looks good and is easy to read, works on postman tells me if it is greater than less than or equal too.
